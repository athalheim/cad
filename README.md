# cad
HTML-based CAD 2D software

The goal of this project was to answer the question: can pure HTML-Javascript be used to build a working CAD software?
After a few months, it appeared the answer is yes...
----------------------
 
This software enables a user, from his workstation, to:
 -Build a 2D model;
 -Save data on his workstation;
 -Load the previously saved data;
 -Print this model
 ----------------------
 
 Project was started around January 2020
 At this time, the pandemic was starting
 and it seemed a good opportunity to use this time locked-in to do something useful.
 ----------------------
 
 June 2021
 Initial upload to GitHub
 
 WEB:
   http://www.thalheim.ca/cad/
  (Will be accessible for the next two years+/-)
 After 2023:
  -Setup a web site, 
  -Copy averything from the cAD folder
  -Open using the 'index.html' page.
 You can also copy the CAD folder to your workstation: No load nor save possibl from this setup, though...
 ----------------------
  
 There is a TODO list where you can learn the actual state of the project.
 I might update from time to time...
 Everyone is welcome to build from this canvas.
 Cheers.
